# About
elementZapper is a very small Google Chrome extension that'll allow you to quickly & easily remove elements on any Web page.

Its usage is rather simple: select anything on the page, right click and select "Zap!" and the selected elements will be removed from the page. It's particularly useful for printing only what is relevant to you.

My goal with this extension was to discover Google Chrome's extension development, mainly out of curiosity..

elementZapper is available on the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elementzapper/efeljanahmlnjhckmohcfbgkfdjdmnog?hl=en

# Changelog

## Version 1.1
